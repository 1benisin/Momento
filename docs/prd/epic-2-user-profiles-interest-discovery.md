# Epic 2: User Profiles & Interest Discovery

**Expanded Goal:** This epic builds upon the foundational user profiles to create rich, detailed user representations and implements the core interest discovery system that drives the matching algorithm. It delivers a comprehensive profile system for both participants and hosts, along with the swipeable card deck interface that gathers user preference data. This epic enables the platform to understand user interests and begin the matching process.

2. Profile completion percentage indicator
3. Profile strength scoring and improvement suggestions
4. Privacy controls for different profile sections
5. Profile preview in both participant and host modes
6. Bulk edit functionality for multiple profile sections
7. Profile validation and quality checks
