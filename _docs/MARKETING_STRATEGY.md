# Content & Marketing Strategy

## Viral Marketing & Social Sharing

- A key goal is to encourage participants to post pictures and videos from Momento events on their social media, especially users with a significant following.
- The app should make this process as smooth as possible, potentially through integrations.
- We will encourage users to tag us with `#momento` in their posts. The app's design and messaging should subtly promote this.
- The ideal viral loop is a friend seeing a post and asking, "Where was that? That looked amazing!" leading to the answer, "It was an invite-only thing from an app called Momento."

## Content Creation

- The app will produce and partner with creators on content related to self-improvement, confidence, connecting with people, and dating advice.
  - Inspiration from channels like Charisma on Command and Marni Kinrys.
  - Content will be created for both male and female audiences.
- The goal is to provide content that helps people connect better and escape the ruts caused by traditional dating apps.
- Example content: "Top 20 non-standard questions to get to know someone."

## AI-Powered Pre-Event Engagement

This is a future experimental feature to help participants prepare for an event.

- The AI can help build a user's confidence by reminding them of their positive qualities (potentially drawing from AI interviews with their friends/family).
- Provide conversation starters and topics relevant to the specific event.
- Offer simple, curated tips on socializing and connecting with people.
- **Experiment**: Give participants information about the general topics and interests of other attendees (without revealing who has which interest) to help them find common ground. Example: "People attending this event are generally interested in vintage film, hiking, and specialty coffee."
