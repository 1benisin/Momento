## Dev Notes

**Context from Story 1.1 (Project Setup):**

This story builds upon the foundational project setup from Story 1.1, which established the initial integration with Clerk for authentication and configured the necessary environment variables. The basic user schema in Convex is already linked to Clerk's authentication system.

**Technology Integration:**

- Integrates with existing Clerk authentication system
- Uses Convex database for user profile storage
- Follows existing form patterns from sign-up flow
- Uses existing Convex mutation patterns for user creation

**Source Tree Integration:**

- Authentication screens in `app/(auth)/` directory
- Form components follow patterns from existing sign-up/sign-in flows
- User management mutations in `convex/user.ts`
- Session management using Expo SecureStore

**Required Environment Variables:**

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: The publishable key from your Clerk project dashboard.

**Testing Standards:**

- Test file location: `__tests__/` directories alongside auth components
- Testing framework: Jest + React Native Testing Library
- Test standards: Unit tests for all authentication flows, integration tests with Clerk API
- E2E tests for sign-up and login processes
- Security testing for authentication vulnerabilities

**Key Constraints:**

- Must work with existing Clerk integration from Story 1.1
- Must support both iOS and Android platforms
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing authentication flow
- Must follow security best practices from `docs/development/security.md#authentication-security`
- Use `devLog` from `utils/devLog.ts` for authentication debugging

## Testing

**Test File Location:** `__tests__/` directories alongside auth components
**Test Standards:** Unit tests for all authentication flows, integration tests with Clerk API
**Testing Frameworks:** Jest + React Native Testing Library
**Specific Testing Requirements:**

- Unit tests for all authentication flows
- Integration tests with Clerk API
- E2E tests for sign-up and login processes
- Security testing for authentication vulnerabilities
- Cross-platform testing (iOS/Android)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2024-12-19

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

The authentication implementation demonstrates solid engineering practices with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and good test coverage. The code follows React Native best practices and integrates well with Clerk's authentication system. However, there are several areas where the implementation could be enhanced for better security, user experience, and maintainability.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `docs/prd/epic-1/story-1.2-user-authentication.md`
  - **Change**: Fixed typo "validationcomplexity" → "validation" in task list
  - **Why**: Corrected documentation error that could confuse future developers
  - **How**: Improves code documentation accuracy and maintainability

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Good adherence to TypeScript best practices, proper error handling, and consistent naming conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Files are properly organized in `app/(auth)/` and `components/auth/` directories
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive test coverage with proper mocking of Clerk dependencies
- All ACs Met: ⚠️ Partially - Most ACs are implemented but some security measures are missing

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Fixed documentation typo in story file
- [x] Verified proper Clerk integration and session management
- [x] Confirmed comprehensive error handling implementation
- [x] Validated logout functionality with audit logging
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Implement rate limiting for SMS/email verification attempts
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Add proper input validation and sanitization for phone numbers
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Implement proper session timeout and token refresh handling
- [ ] Add accessibility improvements for screen readers (missing aria-labels on some elements)
- [ ] Consider extracting authentication logic to custom hooks for better reusability
- [ ] Add integration tests for error scenarios and edge cases
- [ ] Implement proper loading states for all async operations (some missing)

### Security Review

**Critical Issues Found:**

1. **Missing Rate Limiting**: No rate limiting implementation for SMS/email verification attempts, making the system vulnerable to brute force attacks
2. **Insufficient Input Validation**: Phone number validation relies solely on the third-party library without additional sanitization
3. **Session Management**: While Clerk handles session management, there's no custom session timeout configuration

**Addressed:**

- ✓ Proper error handling prevents information leakage
- ✓ Audit logging implemented for sign-out events
- ✓ Secure token storage through Clerk's tokenCache

### Performance Considerations

- ✓ Efficient component rendering with proper state management
- ✓ Good use of React Native optimizations (KeyboardAvoidingView, etc.)
- ⚠️ Phone number input component could benefit from memoization for better performance
- ⚠️ Consider implementing debouncing for form validation

### Final Status

✗ **Changes Required** - Critical security vulnerabilities must be addressed before approval

**Priority Actions Required:**

1. Implement rate limiting for verification attempts
2. Add comprehensive input validation and sanitization
3. Configure proper session timeout and token refresh
4. Add missing accessibility features

The implementation shows good engineering practices but requires security hardening before production deployment.
