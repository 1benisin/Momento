# User Flow Documentation Checklist

**Process Note:** We are documenting each user flow in its own separate markdown file inside the `_docs/USER_FLOWS/` directory. This checklist tracks our progress. Each new file should be named with a number prefix (e.g., `03_host_onboarding.md`). The main `_docs/USER_FLOWS/README.md` file will serve as an index linking to all individual flow documents.
