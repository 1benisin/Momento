# User Interface Design Goals

## Overall UX Vision

Momento's interface should feel like a premium, tactile experience that bridges the digital and physical worlds. The design should evoke the mystery and anticipation of discovering new connections while maintaining the sophistication of Art Deco aesthetics. Users should feel like they're holding a "living blueprint" that guides them toward meaningful experiences, with animations that feel organic and purposeful rather than flashy.
