# Goals and Background Context

## Goals

- Enable users to discover and attend curated, invite-only group events that foster genuine connections
- Provide hosts with tools to create compelling experiences and manage committed audiences
- Establish a $5 "Cost of a Handshake" confirmation fee system that reduces no-shows and ensures commitment
- Create a safe, verified environment where users can build meaningful relationships through real-world experiences
- Build an AI-powered matching system that creates balanced groups with high social chemistry
- Develop a scalable platform that can support both individual hosts and community partners

## Background Context

Momento addresses the growing disconnect between digital connectivity and genuine human relationships. Modern social and dating apps have created user fatigue through endless swiping and superficial interactions, while traditional event platforms lack the curation and commitment mechanisms needed for meaningful experiences. The platform combines intelligent AI matching with real-world facilitation, using a $5 confirmation fee as a commitment signal that significantly reduces no-shows compared to free events. This model serves three distinct user types: participants seeking authentic connections, individual hosts wanting to share their passions, and community hosts (businesses) looking to drive foot traffic and build community.
