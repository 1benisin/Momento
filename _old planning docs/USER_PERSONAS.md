The Momento ecosystem is comprised of three key roles. An individual account can potentially hold multiple roles. This document fleshes out those roles into specific personas to guide product development.

## 1. The Participant: "Alex, the Newcomer"

- **Role:** `Participant`
- **Bio:** Alex is 28 years old, a graphic designer who moved to a new city six months ago for a job. She's found it hard to meet like-minded people outside of work. She's an introvert but is eager to find a small, core group of friends who share her interests in art, indie films, and urban exploration.

### Goals:

- To find genuine connections and meet like-minded people in a low-pressure setting. She's open to dating, but tired of the high-stakes, one-on-one nature of traditional apps.
- To discover interesting, off-the-beaten-path activities in her new city.
- To feel safe and comfortable in social settings with strangers.
- To build a "memory book" of people she's met and experiences she's had.

### Frustrations:

- **Dating App Fatigue:** Tired of the endless swiping, superficial conversations, and ghosting. She finds the pressure to be "on" all the time is exhausting.
- **Logistical Hurdles:** Finds it difficult to be the one to organize group outings and coordinate schedules.
- **Social Awkwardness:** Dislikes the initial awkwardness of trying to find a group at a crowded bar or wondering if she's in the right place.
- **Superficiality:** Feels that most social mixers are loud and don't lead to deep conversations.

### How Momento Helps Alex:

- **Curated Events:** Momento does the planning for her, inviting her to events based on her deep interests.
- **Low Pressure:** The small group setting and focus on a shared activity removes the pressure of one-on-one dating.
- **The "Signal" Arrival:** The `arrival_signpost` and `DeckOfCardsAttendee` features eliminate the anxiety of arrival, giving her a clear, confident way to connect with her group.
- **Post-Event Connection:** The `MemoryBookTab` and private messaging allow her to build on a connection after the event, when she feels more comfortable.
- **Safety:** The mandatory host verification and user reporting tools make her feel secure.

## 2. The User Host: "David, the Curator"

- **Role:** `User Host`
- **Bio:** David is a 34-year-old high school history teacher. He has a passion for creating unique experiences, whether it's a historical walking tour of his neighborhood, a themed potluck, or a weekend board game tournament. He gets a lot of satisfaction from bringing people together and seeing them connect.

### Goals:

- To share his passions and knowledge with an enthusiastic audience.
- To have powerful but simple tools to create and manage multi-stop, dynamic events.
- To build a reputation as a great host and receive positive feedback.
- To meet new people who appreciate the effort he puts into planning.

### Frustrations:

- **The Flakiness of Friends:** Loves his friends, but finds it frustrating when they repeatedly bail on plans he's spent hours organizing.
- **Payment Awkwardness:** Hates having to chase people down for money for tickets or shared costs.
- **Limited Tools:** Using a combination of group chats, calendar invites, and spreadsheets to manage events is clunky and inefficient.

### How Momento Helps David:

- **Committed Audience:** The $5 confirmation fee ensures that attendees are invested and less likely to be no-shows.
- **Powerful Itinerary Tools:** The `CreateEventFlow` allows him to build a detailed, multi-stop itinerary with maps, times, and descriptions, all in one place.
- **Automated Logistics:** The app handles invitations, reminders, and calendar integrations, freeing him up to focus on the creative aspects of his event.
- **Reputation Building:** The `Host Profile` and public ratings give him a way to showcase his success and attract people to his future events.
- **Host as Attendee:** The option to participate in his own event means he doesn't have to choose between organizing and connecting.

## 3. The Community Host: "The Juniper Cafe"

- **Role:** `Community Host`
- **Bio:** The Juniper Cafe is a local, independent coffee shop with a passion for community. They have a beautiful space but struggle with inconsistent foot traffic, especially on weeknights. They want to find creative ways to bring new customers in the door.

### Goals:

- To increase foot traffic and revenue during off-peak hours.
- To build a loyal, local customer base.
- To market their space and products to a new, relevant audience.
- To become known as a community hub, not just a place to buy coffee.

### Frustrations:

- **Traditional Marketing is Ineffective:** Finds that social media ads have a low ROI and don't build real community.
- **High Cost of Acquisition:** Spends a lot on marketing for very little return in terms of new, regular customers.
- **Event Management is Time-Consuming:** Doesn't have the staff or expertise to manage ticketing, promotion, and communication for events.

### How Momento Helps The Juniper Cafe:

- **Targeted Audience:** Momento brings in groups of pre-vetted, local individuals who are actively looking for new experiences.
- **Zero Upfront Cost:** Unlike traditional advertising, hosting on Momento costs them nothing. They make money from the customers who attend the event.
- **Turnkey Solution:** Momento handles all the logistics: curating the attendees, managing the invites, sending reminders, and processing payments. The cafe just has to provide the space and the experience (e.g., a "Latte Art Workshop").
- **Brand Building:** By hosting successful events, they build a reputation as a vibrant community space, which is showcased through their `Host Profile` ratings. This generates positive word-of-mouth and repeat business.
