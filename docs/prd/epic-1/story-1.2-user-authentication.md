# Story 1.2: User Authentication Flow

## Status

Ready for QA

## Story

**As a** new user,
**I want** to sign up using SMS or email authentication,
**so that** I can create my account and access the Momento platform.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Sign-up screen implemented with clean, intuitive interface for both authentication options
2. SMS authentication working for US phone numbers with verification code delivery
3. Email authentication with proper validation
4. Clerk integration configured with user creation and profile setup
5. Error handling and user feedback system implemented
6. Session management with secure token storage and persistence
7. Logout functionality with complete session cleanup
8. Security measures including rate limiting and audit logging

  - [x] Configure secure communication with authentication services

## Dev Notes

**Context from Story 1.1 (Project Setup):**

This story builds upon the foundational project setup from Story 1.1, which established the initial integration with Clerk for authentication and configured the necessary environment variables. The basic user schema in Convex is already linked to Clerk's authentication system.

**Technology Integration:**

- Integrates with existing Clerk authentication system
- Uses Convex database for user profile storage
- Follows existing form patterns from sign-up flow
- Uses existing Convex mutation patterns for user creation

**Source Tree Integration:**

- Authentication screens in `app/(auth)/` directory
- Form components follow patterns from existing sign-up/sign-in flows
- User management mutations in `convex/user.ts`
- Session management using Expo SecureStore

**Required Environment Variables:**

- `EXPO_PUBLIC_CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`: The publishable key from your Clerk project dashboard.

**Testing Standards:**

- Test file location: `__tests__/` directories alongside auth components
- Testing framework: Jest + React Native Testing Library
- Test standards: Unit tests for all authentication flows, integration tests with Clerk API
- E2E tests for sign-up and login processes
- Security testing for authentication vulnerabilities

**Key Constraints:**

- Must work with existing Clerk integration from Story 1.1
- Must support both iOS and Android platforms
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing authentication flow
- Must follow security best practices from `docs/development/security.md#authentication-security`
- Use `devLog` from `utils/devLog.ts` for authentication debugging

## Testing

**Test File Location:** `__tests__/` directories alongside auth components
**Test Standards:** Unit tests for all authentication flows, integration tests with Clerk API
**Testing Frameworks:** Jest + React Native Testing Library
**Specific Testing Requirements:**

- Unit tests for all authentication flows
- Integration tests with Clerk API
- E2E tests for sign-up and login processes
- Security testing for authentication vulnerabilities
- Cross-platform testing (iOS/Android)
