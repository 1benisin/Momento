# Design Principles

## Core Aesthetic: "Esoteric-Tarot Meets Art Deco"

Momento's design aesthetic draws inspiration from a unique blend of sources, creating a style that feels both mystical and sophisticated. This aesthetic serves to differentiate Momento from typical social apps and create an atmosphere of curated, premium experiences.

### Inspiration Sources

- **Games:** The clean lines and elegant simplicity of Monument Valley and Gris
- **Architecture:** The intricate beauty of Islamic geometric tilework
- **Literature:** The magical, adventure-filled aesthetic of classic storybooks
- **Art History:** Art Deco's geometric precision and luxury materials

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Line Work & Symmetry

- **Delicate line work** with consistent stroke weights
- **Geometric symmetry** through gilded borders, concentric circles, and stepped angles
- **Monoline vectors** - all shapes drawn with a single, constant stroke width
- **Minimal detail** - just enough to convey meaning without visual clutter

### 2. Iconography & Motifs

- **Celestial elements:** Moons, stars, suns, and cosmic imagery
- **Botanical elements:** Vines, leaves, buds, and natural growth patterns
- **Adventure symbols:** Tents, trees, waves, ships, and exploration imagery
- **Frame-like compositions** that contain and organize visual elements

### 3. Color Philosophy

- **Minimal palettes** - mostly black/cream or kraft paper backgrounds
- **Metallic accents** - warm gold for premium feel and emphasis
- **Muted jewel tones** for subtle color variation
- **High contrast** for accessibility and readability

### 4. Architectural Blueprint Vibes

- **Tiny call-outs** and numbered elements
- **Diagrammatic strokes** that feel technical yet elegant
- **Grid-based layouts** with precise alignment
- **Technical precision** balanced with organic curves

## UI/UX Concepts

### Foil-Stamp Effect

Utilizing subtle gold gradients on dark card elements to create a premium, tactile feel. This effect should be used sparingly for important elements like event invitations, premium features, and key call-to-action buttons.

### Living Blueprint Effect

Animating lines to "draw" themselves in on press or load, creating a dynamic, living feel. This could be applied to:

- Event invitations as looping animations
- Gold leaf filigree that gently moves
- Decorative lines that sparkle or shimmer
- Inspired by the "living photos" in Harry Potter

### Animated Illustrations

Turning static elements into dynamic experiences:

- Lines that animate in sequence
- Elements that respond to user interaction
- Subtle motion that adds life without distraction
- Performance-optimized animations that work across devices

## Experiential Design Philosophy

### "This is an Adventure, Not an Interview"

Every interaction should feel exciting and meaningful, not like filling out paperwork. This principle guides:

- **Onboarding flows** that feel like exploration rather than data collection
- **Interest discovery** that reveals possibilities rather than asking questions
- **Event invitations** that feel like receiving a special invitation to an adventure
- **User journeys** that build anticipation and excitement

### Quality Over Quantity

- **Immediate communication** that Momento is about high-quality, curated experiences
- **Premium feel** that differentiates from typical "let's grab drinks" meetup apps
- **Genuine excitement** for first real invitation from moment of signup
- **Curated experiences** rather than mass-market social networking

## Visual Hierarchy Principles

### 1. Central Hierarchy

- **Title elements** sit dead-center, creating clear focal points
- **Symmetrical borders** with leafy vine motifs framing content
- **Two-world composition** - adventure elements above, home/nature below
- **Clear visual separation** between different content areas

### 2. Organic Meets Geometric

- **Swirling organic curves** (water, clouds) meeting rigid structures seamlessly
- **Geometric precision** balanced with natural flow
- **Rigid elements** (Big Ben, ship rigging) integrated with flowing forms
- **Harmonious contrast** between straight and curved elements

### 3. Decorative Integration

- **Botanical borders** with tiny leaves, buds, and curling tendrils
- **Scenic vignettes** that tell stories within the design
- **Celestial accents** - crescent moons, tiny stars, radiating sunbursts
- **Functional decoration** that enhances rather than distracts

## Implementation Guidelines

### MVP Phase Considerations

For the initial MVP, prioritize:

- **Clean, functional UI** that works reliably
- **Standard components** that are well-tested and accessible
- **Core functionality** over complex visual effects
- **Solid foundation** before layering in unique design elements

### Future Phase Enhancements

In later phases, gradually introduce:

- **Foil-stamp effects** on premium elements
- **Animated illustrations** for key interactions
- **Living blueprint effects** for special moments
- **Advanced decorative elements** once core functionality is solid

## Accessibility Integration

- **High contrast ratios** for all text and interactive elements
- **Clear visual hierarchy** that works with screen readers
- **Consistent interaction patterns** that are predictable
- **Alternative text** for all decorative elements
- **Keyboard navigation** support for all interactive elements
