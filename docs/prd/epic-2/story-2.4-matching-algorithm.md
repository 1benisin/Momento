# Story 2.4: Interest Matching Algorithm Foundation

As a participant,
I want my interests to be used for event matching,
so that I receive invitations to events that align with my preferences.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Interest-to-event matching logic implementation
2. User preference scoring system
3. Event categorization and tagging system
4. Basic matching algorithm for event recommendations
5. User preference weight adjustment capabilities
6. Matching confidence scoring
7. Preference learning from user behavior
8. Matching algorithm performance metrics
