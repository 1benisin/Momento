# Project Overview

Momento is a social app designed to help people connect through curated, invite-only events. The goal is to move beyond traditional dating apps and foster genuine connections, both platonic and romantic, in small group settings.

The core of Momento is the "event" â€” a thoughtfully planned gathering hosted by a fellow user, a local business, or a service provider. Participants are invited based on a deep, multi-dimensional understanding of their interests, passions, and personalities. Our goal is to move past superficial profiles and create the ideal conditions for authentic friendships and relationships to blossom.

The app encourages living in the moment, assuring users that connection and communication with other attendees can happen through the app after the event, freeing them to be present and engaged during the experience itself.
