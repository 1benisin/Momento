# Epic 4: Matching Algorithm & Invitations

**Expanded Goal:** This epic develops the core matching system that connects participants with events and implements the invitation delivery mechanism. It creates the intelligent algorithm that considers user interests, preferences, and availability to send targeted invitations, ensuring high-quality matches and optimal event attendance. This epic enables the platform to curate meaningful experiences and drive user engagement.

## Story 4.1: Matching Algorithm Core Logic

As a participant,
I want to receive event invitations that match my interests and preferences,
so that I can discover relevant experiences that I'm likely to enjoy.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Interest-based matching algorithm implementation
2. User preference scoring and weighting system
3. Event categorization and tagging for matching
4. Location-based filtering and distance calculations
5. Availability and scheduling conflict detection
6. Matching confidence scoring and ranking
7. Algorithm performance monitoring and metrics
8. A/B testing framework for algorithm optimization

## Story 4.2: Invitation Delivery System

As a participant,
I want to receive event invitations through multiple channels,
so that I never miss opportunities to attend interesting events.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. SMS invitation delivery via Twilio integration
2. Push notification delivery via Expo Push
3. In-app notification center and invitation feed
4. Email invitation delivery via Postmark
5. Invitation scheduling and timing optimization
6. Delivery status tracking and confirmation
7. Invitation frequency and volume controls
8. Opt-out and preference management for notifications

## Story 4.3: Invitation Response and RSVP System

As a participant,
I want to easily respond to event invitations and manage my RSVPs,
so that I can commit to events and help hosts plan accordingly.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Accept/decline invitation functionality
2. RSVP status tracking and updates
3. Confirmation fee payment flow for accepted invitations
4. RSVP deadline management and reminders
5. Waitlist functionality for full events
6. RSVP change and cancellation capabilities
7. Host notification of RSVP changes
8. RSVP analytics and reporting for hosts

## Story 4.4: Group Balancing and Social Chemistry

As a participant,
I want to attend events with balanced groups that have good social chemistry,
so that I can have meaningful interactions and build connections.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Group composition algorithm for balanced demographics
2. Social chemistry scoring based on shared interests
3. Gender balance and diversity considerations
4. Group size optimization for different event types
5. Conflict detection for incompatible attendees
6. Dynamic group adjustment based on RSVPs
7. Host preferences for group composition
8. Group chemistry feedback and learning system

## Story 4.5: Invitation Analytics and Optimization

As a platform administrator,
I want to track invitation performance and optimize the matching system,
so that we can improve user satisfaction and event success rates.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Invitation acceptance rate tracking
2. User engagement metrics and analysis
3. Event success correlation with matching quality
4. Algorithm performance monitoring dashboard
5. User feedback collection and analysis
6. Matching algorithm A/B testing capabilities
7. Performance optimization recommendations
8. Data-driven algorithm improvement processes
