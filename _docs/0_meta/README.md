This directory contains meta-documents that describe how to create, structure, and maintain the project's documentation.

### Files

- **`STANDARDS.md`**: The rulebook for our documentation. It explains the required formats, callout styles, and general best practices to follow.
  - **When to update:** Update this file only when we agree to change our documentation process itself (e.g., adding a new callout type or changing file header requirements).
