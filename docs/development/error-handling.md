## Error Handling Overview

Momento's error handling strategy is designed to provide clear feedback to users, actionable logs for developers, and robust recovery flows for critical failures. All errors are categorized, logged, and monitored for trends.

### Principles

- **User Clarity**: Users receive clear, actionable error messages
- **Developer Insight**: All errors are logged with context for debugging
- **Fail Gracefully**: The app recovers from errors without data loss or user confusion
- **Security**: Sensitive error details are never exposed to users
- **Monitoring**: All critical errors are monitored and trigger alerts

---

## Error Categorization

### Error Types

- **Validation Errors**: User input is invalid or missing
- **Authentication Errors**: User is not authenticated or session expired
- **Authorization Errors**: User lacks permission for the action
- **Network Errors**: Connectivity issues or timeouts
- **Payment Errors**: Payment failed, declined, or disputed
- **External Service Errors**: Third-party API failures (Stripe, Clerk, etc.)
- **Internal Server Errors**: Unexpected backend failures
- **Business Logic Errors**: Violations of business rules (e.g., RSVP after deadline)
- **Safety & Moderation Errors**: Issues with reporting, blocking, or moderation

### Severity Levels

- **Info**: Non-critical, informational
- **Warning**: Recoverable, user can retry
- **Error**: Action failed, user needs to take action
- **Critical**: System failure, requires immediate attention

---

## User-Facing Error Messages

### Guidelines

- **Clarity**: Use plain language, avoid technical jargon
- **Actionable**: Suggest next steps or recovery actions
- **Empathy**: Acknowledge user frustration
- **Security**: Never expose stack traces or sensitive details

### Examples

- **Validation**: "Please enter a valid email address."
- **Authentication**: "Your session has expired. Please sign in again."
- **Payment**: "Payment failed. Please check your card details or try another method."
- **Network**: "Unable to connect. Please check your internet connection."
- **Server**: "Something went wrong. Please try again later."

---

## Backend Error Logging

### Logging Strategy

- **Structured Logging**: Use JSON logs with error type, message, user ID, and context
- **Sensitive Data**: Never log passwords, payment details, or PII
- **Correlation IDs**: Attach unique IDs to trace errors across services
- **Log Levels**: Use info, warn, error, and critical levels

### Example Log Entry

```json
{
  "level": "error",
  "timestamp": "2024-12-19T12:34:56Z",
  "userId": "user_123",
  "errorType": "PaymentError",
  "message": "Payment declined by Stripe",
  "context": {
    "paymentIntentId": "pi_abc123",
    "amount": 500
  }
}
```

## Payment Error Handling

### Common Payment Errors

- **Card Declined**: Prompt user to try another card
- **Insufficient Funds**: Suggest alternate payment method
- **Payment Timeout**: Allow retry
- **Duplicate Payment**: Prevent double charges with idempotency
- **Refund Failure**: Notify user and log for manual review

### User Messaging

- "Your card was declined. Please try a different card."
- "Payment could not be processed. Please try again."
- "A refund could not be completed. Our team has been notified."

### Logging & Monitoring

- Log all payment failures with Stripe error codes
- Monitor for spikes in payment errors
- Alert on repeated failures for a single user or event

---

## Safety & Moderation Error Handling

### Reporting & Blocking

- **Failed Report Submission**: "We couldn't submit your report. Please try again."
- **Moderation Action Failed**: Log and escalate to human review
- **User Block Failure**: "Unable to block user. Please try again later."

### Logging

- Log all failed moderation actions with context
- Alert on repeated failures

---

## API Error Handling

### Standardized Error Responses

- **HTTP 400**: Validation errors
- **HTTP 401**: Authentication required
- **HTTP 403**: Permission denied
- **HTTP 404**: Resource not found
- **HTTP 409**: Conflict (e.g., duplicate RSVP)
- **HTTP 422**: Unprocessable entity
- **HTTP 429**: Rate limit exceeded
- **HTTP 500**: Internal server error

### Error Response Format

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "PAYMENT_FAILED",
    "message": "Payment could not be processed."
  }
}
```

### Client-Side Handling

- Display user-friendly messages
- Retry on network errors
- Log errors for diagnostics
- Report critical errors to monitoring service

---

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Tools

- **Sentry**: Application error monitoring
- **Datadog**: Infrastructure and API monitoring
- **Stripe Dashboard**: Payment error monitoring
- **Custom Dashboards**: Track error rates and trends

### Alerting

- Alert on spikes in error rates
- Alert on repeated payment failures
- Alert on critical system errors
- Escalate to on-call engineer for critical incidents

---

## Recovery Flows

### Automatic Recovery

- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries for transient errors
- **Fallbacks**: Use cached data or alternate flows on failure
- **Graceful Degradation**: Disable non-critical features if needed

### Manual Recovery

- **Admin Tools**: Manual intervention for stuck payments or moderation
- **User Support**: Clear instructions for contacting support
- **Incident Review**: Post-mortem analysis for critical failures
