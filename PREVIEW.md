# Welcome to Momento: A Private Preview

Hey there! Thanks for taking a look at my project, Momento.

This repo is currently private because it's the foundation of a startup I'm building, but I wanted to share a peek under the hood. I'm passionate about building products that solve real problems, and I'm equally passionate about the _way_ they get built.

## What is Momento?

In a world of endless swiping and digital noise, Momento is a social app designed to spark real-world connections. The goal is to move beyond superficial interactions and help people build genuine relationships through curated, invite-only events. It's less about matching profiles and more about matching passions.

## My Development Philosophy: Architecting with AI

As a technical product manager and architect, I don't just "use AI" to code. I've designed a structured, multi-step development workflow that leverages AI as a strategic partner. This isn't about being a "code monkey" asking an AI to fix a bug; it's about systematically translating a product vision into robust, well-architected code.

Here's my process:

### Step 1: The AI-Assisted PRD (Product Requirements Document)

- **The Goal:** It all starts with a clear vision. I use a custom-designed proompting strategy to collaborate with an AI to flesh out a full Product Requirements Document for any new feature.
- **The Output:** A comprehensive PRD that details user stories, acceptance criteria, edge cases, and technical considerations. This ensures we're building the _right thing_ before a single line of code is written.

### Step 2: From PRD to Actionable Task List

- **The Goal:** A PRD is great, but it's not a project plan. I use another specialized AI workflow to break down the PRD into a granular, ordered list of engineering tasks.
- **The Output:** A clear, step-by-step task list. This de-risks the development process, clarifies dependencies, and makes the actual coding phase incredibly efficient.

### Step 3: Single-Task AI Coding Execution

- **The Goal:** With a crystal-clear task in hand, I then move to focused, AI-assisted coding. Because the "what" and "why" are already defined, I can focus on the "how"â€”writing clean, scalable, and maintainable code.
- **The Output:** High-quality, targeted code that directly maps to the PRD.

This structured approach ensures that AI is used strategically to enhance planning and architecture, not just as a code generator. It's a cutting-edge software engineering practice that blends product vision with technical execution.

## Tech Stack & Architecture

I'm building Momento with a modern, scalable, and maintainable tech stack.

- **Frontend:** React Native (using Expo for rapid development)
- **Backend:** Node.js with Express/Fastify (or potentially a serverless approach with AWS Lambda)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL for relational data, possibly Redis for caching/queues.
- **Payments:** Stripe for secure payment processing.
- **Cloud:** Deployed on AWS (or similar cloud provider).

## Project Highlights & Features

The private code includes the implementation of several core features:

- **Multi-faceted User Profiles:** Capturing public, private, and internal data to power a sophisticated matching engine.
- **AI-Driven Onboarding:** A flow designed to build a deep, multidimensional map of a user's interests and values.
- **Curated Invitation System:** A unique weekly "drop" model for events that discourages endless browsing and encourages deliberate action.
- **Host/Venue Rating System:** Building trust and quality into the ecosystem.
- **Secure Payment Integration:** A system for event fees that confirms user commitment and reduces no-shows.

I hope this gives you a good sense of both my product vision and my technical approach. I'd be happy to walk you through a live demo or even share temporary access to the repository to discuss the code itself.

Thanks for your time!
