# Story 5.2: The Signal Arrival Experience

As a participant,
I want to check in at events using the "Deck of Cards" system,
so that I can easily identify my group and eliminate arrival awkwardness.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. "Deck of Cards" check-in interface design
2. Unique card assignment for each attendee
3. Real-time check-in status tracking
4. Group identification and connection facilitation
5. Check-in location and time validation
6. Host notification of attendee arrivals
7. Check-in analytics and attendance tracking
8. Offline check-in capability for poor connectivity
