# Momento Design System

Welcome to the Momento design system documentation! This collection provides comprehensive guidance for maintaining visual consistency and creating exceptional user experiences across the platform.

## Design Philosophy

Momento's design aesthetic draws inspiration from a unique blend of sources, aiming for a style that feels like an **"esoteric-tarot meets Art Deco mash-up."** Our core philosophy is that **this is an adventure, not an interview** - every interaction should feel exciting and meaningful.
