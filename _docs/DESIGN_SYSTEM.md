# Design System & Inspiration

**Note on MVP Implementation:** The concepts outlined in this document represent the long-term design vision for Momento. For the initial MVP, development will prioritize a clean, standard, and functional UI to ensure a solid foundation before layering in more complex and unique design elements.

The design aesthetic for Momento draws inspiration from a unique blend of sources, aiming for a style that feels like an "esoteric-tarot meets Art Deco mash-up."

**Core Principles:**

- Delicate line work and geometric symmetry (gilded borders, concentric circles, stepped angles).
- Celestial & botanical iconography (moons, stars, suns, vines) tucked into frame-like compositions.
- Minimal palettesâ€”mostly black/cream or kraft paper with pops of metallic-gold or muted jewel tones.
- Architectural/blueprint vibes via tiny call-outs, numbering, and diagrammatic strokes.

**UI/UX Concepts:**

- **Foil-Stamp Effect:** Utilizing subtle gold gradients on dark card elements to create a premium, tactile feel.
- **Animated Illustrations:** Animating lines to "draw" themselves in on hover or load, creating a "living blueprint" effect. This could be applied to event invitations, turning them into looping GIFs where elements like gold leaf filigree gently move or decorative lines sparkle. This is inspired by the "living photos" in Harry Potter.
