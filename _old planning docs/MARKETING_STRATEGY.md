# Content & Marketing Strategy

## Viral Marketing & Social Sharing

- A key goal is to encourage participants to post pictures and videos from Momento events on their social media, especially users with a significant following.
- The app should make this process as smooth as possible, potentially through integrations.
- We will encourage users to tag us with `#momento` in their posts. The app's design and messaging should subtly promote this.
- The ideal viral loop is a friend seeing a post and asking, "Where was that? That looked amazing!" leading to the answer, "It was an invite-only thing from an app called Momento."

## Content Creation

- The app will produce and partner with creators on content related to self-improvement, confidence, connecting with people, and dating advice.
  - Inspiration from channels like Charisma on Command and Marni Kinrys.
  - Content will be created for both male and female audiences.
- The goal is to provide content that helps people connect better and escape the ruts caused by traditional dating apps.
- Example content: "Top 20 non-standard questions to get to know someone."

## Monetization & Affiliate Program

### Primary Model: Free App with Per-Event Fee

- The primary monetization strategy is to offer the Momento app for free.
- Revenue will be generated by charging users a fee (e.g., $5) when they accept an invitation to an event.
- This model lowers the barrier to entry, encouraging downloads and user growth, which is critical for the app's network effect.

### Affiliate Model: Revenue Share on Event Fees

- We will implement an affiliate program to incentivize marketers and influencers.
- Affiliates will use unique tracking links to refer new users.
- When a referred user accepts and pays for an event, the affiliate will receive a percentage of the event fee.
- This approach aligns affiliate incentives with our core monetization strategy and avoids the user friction of a paid app.

## Host Acquisition & Marketing

To attract high-quality hosts, the strategy will focus on framing Momento as a curated audience and marketing partner, not just a ticketing platform. The core message is: "Stop trying to find customers. Host an event on Momento, and we'll bring the right people to you."

### Target Host Profiles

1.  **The Hospitality Host (Filling Seats & Spaces):**
    - **Who:** Restaurants, wine bars, breweries, cafes.

2.  **The Skills-Based Host (Supplementing Income):**
