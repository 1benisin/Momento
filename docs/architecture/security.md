## Security Overview

Momento handles sensitive user data including personal information, payment details, and location data. Our security approach follows the principle of **defense in depth** with multiple layers of protection.

### Security Principles

- **Zero Trust Architecture**: Verify every request, never assume trust
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Users and systems have minimal required access
- **Data Minimization**: Collect only necessary data for platform functionality
- **Transparency**: Clear communication about data usage and security measures
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time security monitoring and threat detection

## Authentication & Authorization

### Authentication Flow

#### User Registration

1. **Phone/Email Verification**: Primary authentication method using Clerk
2. **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Optional but recommended for all users
3. **Session Management**: Secure session tokens with automatic expiration
4. **Device Tracking**: Monitor and alert on suspicious login patterns

#### Host Verification

1. **Stripe Identity Integration**: Government-issued ID verification
2. **Address Verification**: Physical address validation
3. **Background Checks**: Optional enhanced verification for community hosts
4. **Verification Expiry**: Annual re-verification requirement

### Authorization Controls

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- **Participant**: Access to social features, event attendance
- **User Host**: Event creation, attendee management
- **Community Host**: Business event creation, enhanced features
- **Hybrid User**: Combined permissions based on active mode

#### API Authorization

- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based API authentication
- **Scope-Based Permissions**: Granular permission controls
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse and brute force attacks
- **IP Whitelisting**: Restrict access to known IP ranges for admin functions

## Payment Security

### PCI DSS Compliance

#### Payment Processing

- **Stripe Integration**: PCI DSS Level 1 compliant payment processor
- **Tokenization**: Payment methods tokenized, never stored in plain text
- **Secure Elements**: Mobile payment elements use secure enclaves
- **Fraud Detection**: Stripe Radar integration for fraud prevention

#### Payment Flow Security

1. **Client-Side Validation**: Input validation and sanitization
2. **Server-Side Validation**: Comprehensive validation on all payment endpoints
3. **Webhook Verification**: Verify webhook signatures from Stripe
4. **Idempotency**: Prevent duplicate payment processing
5. **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all payment activities

### PCI DSS Compliance Implementation

The Momento platform adheres to PCI DSS requirements by leveraging Stripe's client-side encryption and tokenization, which ensures that sensitive cardholder data never touches the application servers.

- **Tokenization**: The Stripe React Native SDK captures card details within a secure, sandboxed UI component. This information is sent directly to Stripe's servers, which return a non-sensitive token. This token is then used for all subsequent payment operations. This approach prevents raw card data from being stored, processed, or transmitted by the Momento backend.

- **Client-Side Implementation**: The `components/PaymentSheet.tsx` component utilizes the `usePaymentSheet` hook from `@stripe/stripe-react-native`. This hook manages the entire payment UI and data capture process, ensuring that the client-side implementation is PCI compliant out-of-the-box.

- **Backend Implementation**: The backend, specifically in `convex/payments.ts`, only ever receives and handles the tokenized payment method information. All interactions with the Stripe API are performed using these tokens, which means the backend is never exposed to raw cardholder data.

- **Webhook Security**: All incoming webhooks from Stripe are verified using a webhook signing secret, as implemented in `convex/webhooks.ts`. This prevents spoofing and ensures that only legitimate requests from Stripe are processed. The `verifyWebhookSignature` function in `convex/lib/stripe.ts` uses the `stripe.webhooks.constructEvent` method, which is the standard and secure way to handle webhook verification.

By following this architecture, the Momento platform significantly reduces its PCI compliance scope, as the handling of sensitive cardholder data is outsourced to Stripe, a certified Level 1 PCI Service Provider.
