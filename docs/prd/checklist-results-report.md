## Top Issues by Priority

### BLOCKERS: None

The PRD is ready for architectural design.

### HIGH: Minor Improvements

- Add specific data retention policies for user data and event history
- Clarify backup and recovery requirements for Convex database
- Define specific performance benchmarks for matching algorithm

### MEDIUM: Enhancements

- Include more detailed API requirements for third-party integrations
- Add specific monitoring and alerting requirements
- Define deployment frequency expectations

### LOW: Nice to Have

- Add more detailed competitive analysis references
- Include specific user research methodology details
- Expand on future enhancement roadmap details

## MVP Scope Assessment

**Features Appropriately Scoped for MVP:**

- Core authentication and role-based onboarding
- Basic profile creation and interest discovery
- Host verification and event creation
- Simple matching algorithm with invitation system
- Event lifecycle management with payment processing
- Basic safety and moderation features

**Features Correctly Deferred:**

- Memory Book & Face Cards (Phase 2)
- Dynamic Duos (Phase 2)
- Advanced AI features (Phase 3)
- Post-event messaging (Phase 2)

**Timeline Realism:** 6-month development cycle is realistic for the defined scope.

## Technical Readiness

**Technical Constraints Clearly Defined:**

- React Native with Expo for cross-platform development
- Convex for real-time backend and database
- Stripe for payments and identity verification
- Clerk for authentication
- Specific integration requirements documented

**Identified Technical Risks:**

- Real-time matching algorithm performance at scale
- Geospatial query optimization
- Payment processing compliance
- Data privacy and GDPR compliance

**Areas Needing Architect Investigation:**

- Convex schema design for optimal performance
- Matching algorithm implementation details
- Real-time notification system architecture
- Offline capability implementation strategy

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate Actions (Before Architecture):**

   - Define specific data retention policies
   - Clarify backup and recovery requirements
   - Set performance benchmarks for key user flows

2. **Architecture Phase Considerations:**

   - Focus on Convex schema design and optimization
   - Plan for matching algorithm scalability
   - Design comprehensive testing strategy
   - Establish monitoring and observability framework

3. **Development Phase Preparation:**
   - Set up development environment standards
   - Establish code quality and testing requirements
   - Plan for iterative deployment strategy

## Final Decision

**READY FOR ARCHITECT**: The PRD and epics are comprehensive, properly structured, and ready for architectural design. The document provides clear technical guidance, well-defined user stories, and appropriate MVP scope. Minor clarifications can be addressed during the architecture phase without blocking progress.
