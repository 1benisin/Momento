# Notification Strategy & Implementation Plan

This document outlines the complete plan for user notifications, covering four key areas:

- **[Services & Architecture](#1-services--architecture)**: Details the technology stack (Expo for Push, Twilio for SMS) and the Supabase Edge Function architecture that will power the system.
- **[Database Schema Additions](#2-database-schema-additions)**: Defines the new `push_notification_tokens` and `user_notification_settings` tables required to store device tokens and user preferences.
- **[Notification Triggers & Content](#3-notification-triggers--content)**: A comprehensive list of every notification in the app, categorized by type (Event, Social, Account) with suggested message content.
- **[Advanced Scenarios & Best Practices](#4-advanced-scenarios--best-practices)**: Discusses implementation details for more complex features like chat message bundling, deep linking, and in-app notifications.
- **[User-Facing Settings UI](#5-user-facing-settings-ui)**: Details the organized, context-grouped layout for the notification toggles as we designed.

## 1. Services & Architecture

We will use a combination of services to handle different types of notifications, all orchestrated by our Supabase backend.

- **Push Notifications (In-App & System):** **Expo Push Notifications**
  - **Why:** As we are using Expo, this is the most tightly integrated and straightforward solution. It provides a single API for both iOS and Android and can be triggered directly from our backend.
  - **Implementation:** We will use `expo-notifications` on the client-side to request permissions and receive notifications. Push tokens for each device will be stored in our database.

- **SMS Notifications:** **Twilio**
  - **Why:** Twilio is a reliable, industry-standard service for programmable SMS. Your `ROADMAP.md` already identified this as a potential service.
  - **Implementation:** We will use the Twilio SDK within a Supabase Edge Function to send SMS messages. This keeps our API keys and logic secure on the server side.

- **Transactional Email:** **Postmark** & **Stripe**
  - **Why:** We use a two-pronged approach for email. **Postmark** is a best-in-class service for developer-driven transactional emails (e.g., security alerts), ensuring maximum deliverability. For payment receipts, we will leverage **Stripe's** automated, compliant, and trusted email receipt system to save development time.
  - **Implementation:** Custom app-related emails will be sent via the Postmark API from a Supabase Edge Function. Payment receipts will be configured in the Stripe dashboard and sent automatically by Stripe.

### Backend Architecture: Convex

The core logic for sending notifications will reside in **Convex Functions**. This is ideal for several reasons:

1.  **Security:** API keys for Expo, Twilio, and Postmark are kept off the client app.
2.  **Triggers:** Functions can be invoked in various ways:
    - **Database Triggers:** A change in a table (e.g., a new row in `invitations`) can automatically trigger a function to send a notification.
    - **Cron Jobs (Scheduled Functions):** We can schedule functions to run at specific intervals for reminders (e.g., "Your event starts in 1 hour").
    - **Directly from the Client:** The app can call an Edge Function for complex, on-demand notifications (like calculating travel time).

## 2. Database Schema Additions

To support notifications and user preferences, our Convex data model has been updated.

### `push_notification_tokens` Table

This collection is defined in `_docs/DATA_MODELS.md`. It stores the unique push tokens for each user's device(s).

### Notification Settings (Embedded in `users` document)

The `user_notification_settings` table has been eliminated in the new Convex schema. This data is now stored as an **embedded object** directly within each `users` document. Our backend logic **must** query this object before sending any notification to respect user choice. This approach is more efficient as it reduces the number of database reads required to get a user's full profile and preferences.

## 3. Notification Triggers & Content

Here is a brainstormed list of potential notifications, their triggers, and suggested content.

## 4. Advanced Scenarios & Best Practices

- **Chat Message Bundling:** To avoid overwhelming users, we should not send a push notification for every single chat message. A better approach is to "bundle" them.
  - **Strategy:** When a message is received, the backend function should wait for a short period (e.g., 1-2 minutes). If no other messages arrive for that user in that window, it sends a single notification ("You have new messages from [Sender Name]"). If more messages arrive, the timer resets.

- **Deep Linking:** All notifications should use deep links. Tapping a notification for an event invitation should take the user directly to that invitation screen in the app, not just the home screen. Expo's Linking library combined with Expo Router handles this well.

- **In-App Notifications:** For notifications while the user is actively using the app (e.g., a new message arrives), we should not use a push notification. Instead, we can use an in-app solution like a temporary banner or toast message at the top of the screen. This can be managed with a global state listener that subscribes to real-time events from Supabase.

## 5. User-Facing Settings UI

To give users clear and granular control, the `NotificationSettingsScreen` (located under the `SettingsScreen` -> `Account Tab`) will present the toggles in logical groups. This keeps all notification settings in one predictable place while still separating them by context.

For a user who is both a participant and a host, the screen would be organized as follows:

#### **Push Notifications**

- `[Toggle]` **Social & Connections**
  - _New Kudos, Mutual Connections, new photos in event galleries, etc._
- `[Toggle]` **Direct Messages**
  - _Messages from other participants._
- `[Toggle]` **Event Invitations & Reminders**
  - _New invites, event updates, and reminders to provide feedback._

#### **Host Notifications**

_*This entire section is only visible to users with a Host profile.*_

- `[Toggle]` **Attendee Messages & Event Posts**
  - _Messages from your event attendees and posts in your event feeds._
- `[Toggle]` **Event & Attendee Updates**
  - _Event confirmed, event is full, check-in reports, etc._
- `[Toggle]` **Content Moderation**
  - _Reports on photos in your event galleries._

#### **SMS Notifications**

- `[Toggle]` **Event Invitations**
- `[Toggle]` **Event Reminders & Critical Updates**
  - _For event start times, cancellations, or major detail changes._

#### **Email Notifications**

- `[Toggle]` **Account & Safety**
  - _Critical alerts about your account security._
- `[Info]` **Payment Receipts**
  - _A note explaining that payment receipts are sent automatically by our payment processor, Stripe, and cannot be disabled._
