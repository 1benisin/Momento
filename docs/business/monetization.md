## Revenue Model Overview

### Core Philosophy: "Cost of a Handshake"

Momento's primary revenue stream is a flat **$5 Confirmation Fee** charged to participants when they accept an event invitation. This model is designed with two key principles:

1. **Commitment Device**: The fee elevates an RSVP from a casual "maybe" to a firm commitment
2. **Transparency**: Clear communication that the fee is for curation service, not event costs

### Revenue Model Benefits

#### For Participants

- **Reduced No-Shows**: Financial commitment increases attendance reliability
- **Better Events**: Higher-quality curation due to committed audience
- **Clear Value**: Transparent pricing with no hidden fees

#### For Hosts

- **Reliable Attendance**: Committed participants reduce no-show risk
- **Quality Curation**: Platform invests in finding the right attendees
- **No Platform Fees**: Hosts don't pay for using the platform

#### For Platform

- **Sustainable Revenue**: Predictable, scalable revenue stream
- **Alignment**: Revenue tied to successful event experiences
- **Growth**: Revenue scales with platform usage

## Payment Flow

### User Journey

#### 1. Event Invitation

- User receives personalized event invitation
- Invitation includes event details, host information, and estimated event cost
- **No payment required at invitation stage**

#### 2. Invitation Acceptance

- User reviews event details and decides to attend
- **Payment Required**: $5 confirmation fee charged upon acceptance
- Payment method added if not already on file

#### 3. Payment Processing

- Stripe processes the $5 confirmation fee
- User receives email receipt
- Spot is secured in the event

#### 4. Event Costs (Separate)

- Any additional event costs (tickets, food, etc.) handled directly between participant and host
- Clearly labeled as "Estimated Event Cost" in app
- Momento does not process these payments

### Payment Method Management

#### Adding Payment Methods

```typescript
// User can add multiple payment methods
interface PaymentMethod {
  id: string
  type: 'card' | 'bank_account'
  last4: string
  brand?: string
  isDefault: boolean
}
```

#### Payment Method Flow

1. **First-Time Payment**: User prompted to add payment method
2. **Payment Method Screen**: Dedicated screen for managing payment methods
3. **Transaction History**: Complete history of all payments
4. **Receipts**: Email receipts for all transactions

### Refund Policy

#### Cancellation Scenarios

- **User Cancellation**: Full refund if cancelled 24+ hours before event
- **Host Cancellation**: Full refund to all participants
- **Event Changes**: Participants can cancel and receive full refund
- **No-Show**: No refund (fee serves as commitment device)

#### Refund Processing

```typescript
// Refund flow
interface RefundRequest {
  userId: string
  eventId: string
  reason: 'user_cancellation' | 'host_cancellation' | 'event_changes'
  amount: number
  timestamp: Date
}
```

## Pricing Strategy

### Confirmation Fee: $5

#### Pricing Rationale

#### Price Testing Strategy

- **A/B Testing**: Test different price points ($3, $5, $7)
- **Geographic Testing**: Different prices in different markets
- **User Segment Testing**: Different prices for different user types

### Future Pricing Considerations

#### Dynamic Pricing

- **Peak Times**: Higher fees during high-demand periods
- **Event Type**: Different fees for different event categories
- **User Tier**: Premium users might pay different fees

#### Subscription Models

- **Monthly Pass**: Unlimited events for monthly fee
- **Premium Features**: Advanced features for subscription fee
- **Host Subscriptions**: Premium hosting tools
