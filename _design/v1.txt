1. Color Palette
Background: Deep, inky black (or very dark navy)

Artwork & Border: Warm metallic gold (flat, uniform line weight)

Text: Creamy off-white for high-contrast titles

2. Line-Art Style
Monoline vectors: All shapes drawn with a single, constant stroke width

Minimal detail: Just enough to read tents, trees, waves, ship—no shading or fills

Organic curves & geometry: Swirling water/clouds meet rigid structures (Big Ben, ship rigging) seamlessly

3. Typography
“PETER PAN”: All-caps serif with chunky stems and subtle bracketed serifs—think early-20th-century book-press feel

“JM BARRIE”: Small, spaced-out sans or light serif, nestled under the main title

4. Composition & Layout
Symmetrical border: Leafy vine motif framing all four edges, mirrored left/right & top/bottom

Central hierarchy: Title sits dead-center, splitting two “worlds” above & below

Top half: Adventure-on-the-sea—schooner, canoes, teepees on islands, moon & stars

Bottom half: Home & nature—enchanted tree at dead-center base, London skyline (Big Ben) off to one side, winding water/cloud lines connecting scenes

5. Decorative Motifs
Botanical border: Tiny leaves, buds & curling tendrils

Scenic vignettes:

Teepees and rock-climbing figures

Canoes paddling through dotted-star “sea”

Fairies flitting around flowers

Stylized water ripples and cloud-like swirls

Celestial accents: Crescent moon, tiny stars, radiating sunburst at top
