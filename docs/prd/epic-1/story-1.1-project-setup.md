**Testing Standards & Patterns:**

**Testing Pyramid Approach:**

- **Unit Tests (70%)**: Individual functions and components, 80% minimum coverage
- **Integration Tests (20%)**: Component interactions and API endpoints
- **E2E Tests (10%)**: Complete user workflows, critical business processes

**Frontend Testing:**

- **Framework**: Vitest ^3.2.4 with React Native Testing Library

- **Coverage**: 90% for new code, 80% for modified code, 70% for legacy code
- **Component Testing**: Focus on user interactions and behavior, mock external dependencies
- **Test Structure**: Describe blocks for conditions, it blocks for expected behaviors

**Backend Testing:**

- **Framework**: convex-test ^0.0.37 for Convex functions
- **Location**: `convex/tests/` directory
- **Focus**: Data validation, business rules, error handling, edge cases

- **File Organization**: Domain-driven organization with co-located related files
- **Naming Conventions**: kebab-case for files, PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions
- **Import Organization**: External → Internal → Relative → Type imports

## QA Results

**QA Review by Quinn (Senior Developer & QA Architect)**

**Date:** 2024-07-31

**Summary:**

The project setup has been thoroughly reviewed and meets all acceptance criteria defined in Story 1.1. The technical foundation is robust, well-organized, and ready for future development. The choices made for the technology stack, project structure, and development process are sound and align with industry best practices.

**Verification Details:**

- **Project Structure:** Verified that the project follows the documented organization in the `Dev Notes`. The separation of concerns between `app`, `components`, and `convex` is clear and logical.
- **Dependencies:** Checked `package.json` and confirmed that all key dependencies (Expo, Convex, Clerk, Stripe) are installed and their versions are consistent with the story's requirements.
- **Configuration:**
  - **Convex:** The schema in `convex/schema.ts` correctly defines `users`, `events`, and `locations` tables with appropriate fields for Clerk and Stripe integration. The `convex/auth.config.ts` is correctly configured to use Clerk.
  - **Clerk:** Integration points in the user schema are present.
  - **Stripe:** Schema fields for payment processing and identity verification are correctly defined.
- **Development Environment:** Build scripts in `package.json` and EAS configuration in `eas.json` are properly set up for different environments. Linting and formatting rules are in place and enforced with pre-commit hooks.

**Conclusion:**

This story is **Approved**. The development team has successfully established a strong foundation for the Momento platform.
