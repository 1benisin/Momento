# User Personas & Roles

Momento will have several types of participants and roles within the ecosystem. An individual account can potentially hold multiple roles.

## Stakeholders / Participants

- **Hosts**: This role can be filled by:
  - Regular app users who want to organize an event.
  - Service providers (e.g., a tour guide, dance instructor).
  - Businesses (e.g., a restaurant, event space, boat rental).
- **Participants**: These are users who do not host events but are invited to attend them. Their primary interaction is responding to invitations and participating in the events.
- **Businesses**: These are commercial entities that can act as hosts or simply be venues/services used by other hosts.
  - They will have business profiles with ratings.
  - These ratings will be visible to users and hosts to help them select high-quality venues and services.

## User Profile Types

There will be three primary profile types. An account can have one or more of these types associated with it.

1.  **User (Participant)**:
    - This is the default profile for users who only participate in events.
    - They can browse other profiles, receive invitations, and attend events.
2.  **User Host**:
    - A user who also wants to create and host events.
    - They will have a separate "Host Profile" in addition to their basic user profile.
    - The host profile will display ratings and reviews from past events they've hosted.
3.  **Business Host**:
    - For businesses or service providers who host events.
    - This profile will contain business-specific information like location, hours, photos, and services offered.
    - It will also feature ratings from past events.

Each profile type will have access to a different set of tools and content within the app.
