# Content & Marketing Strategy

## Viral Marketing & Social Sharing

- A key goal is to encourage participants to post pictures and videos from Momento events on their social media, especially users with a significant following.
- The app should make this process as smooth as possible, potentially through integrations.
- We will encourage users to tag us with `#momento` in their posts. The app's design and messaging should subtly promote this.
- The ideal viral loop is a friend seeing a post and asking, "Where was that? That looked amazing!" leading to the answer, "It was an invite-only thing from an app called Momento."

## Content Creation

- The app will produce and partner with creators on content related to self-improvement, confidence, connecting with people, and dating advice.
  - Inspiration from channels like Charisma on Command and Marni Kinrys.
  - Content will be created for both male and female audiences.
- The goal is to provide content that helps people connect better and escape the ruts caused by traditional dating apps.
- Example content: "Top 20 non-standard questions to get to know someone."

> **Future Enhancement (Phase 3):** > **Feature:** AI-Powered Pre-Event Engagement.
> **Rationale:** An AI "hype-man" could build a user's confidence before an event by providing personalized conversation starters, reminders of their positive qualities, and general information about the interests of other attendees (e.g., "The group tonight is into vintage film and hiking"). This would help users feel more prepared and reduce social anxiety.
