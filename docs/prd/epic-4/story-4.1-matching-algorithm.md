# Story 4.1: Matching Algorithm Core Logic

As a participant,
I want to receive event invitations that match my interests and preferences,
so that I can discover relevant experiences that I'm likely to enjoy.

**Acceptance Criteria:**

1. Interest-based matching algorithm implementation
2. User preference scoring and weighting system
3. Event categorization and tagging for matching
4. Location-based filtering and distance calculations
5. Availability and scheduling conflict detection
6. Matching confidence scoring and ranking
7. Algorithm performance monitoring and metrics
8. A/B testing framework for algorithm optimization
