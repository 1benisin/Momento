# Project Overview

Momento is a social application focused on creating curated, real-world experiences to help people connect. The core idea is to move away from the swiping mechanics of traditional dating apps and instead facilitate meaningful interactions through small, invite-only events.

The app aims to build a community around shared interests and passions by carefully matching participants to events. It will cater to different user types, including event participants, hosts (who can be users or businesses), and service providers.

A significant component of the app will be building a multidimensional map of users' passions and interests to ensure high-quality matches and event recommendations. The long-term vision includes AI-driven features to enhance user profiling, event creation, and pre-event engagement.
