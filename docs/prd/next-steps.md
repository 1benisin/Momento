# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

Create a comprehensive UX design system and user experience architecture for the Momento social platform. Focus on the "esoteric-tarot meets Art Deco" aesthetic with premium, tactile feel. Design should support both participant and host user journeys, emphasizing the card-based discovery interface, "The Signal" arrival experience, and seamless mode switching between roles. Ensure accessibility compliance (WCAG AA) and cross-platform consistency across iOS and Android.

## Architect Prompt

Design a scalable technical architecture for the Momento platform using React Native with Expo, Convex backend, and essential integrations (Clerk, Stripe, Twilio, Google Maps). Implement real-time features, geospatial capabilities, and secure payment processing. Focus on the monorepo structure, performance optimization, and comprehensive testing strategy. Ensure the architecture supports the matching algorithm, event lifecycle management, and safety features while maintaining data privacy and compliance standards.
