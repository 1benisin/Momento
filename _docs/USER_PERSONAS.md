# User Roles

The Momento ecosystem is comprised of three key roles. An individual account can potentially hold multiple roles.

- **Participants:** Attend events they are invited to. Their primary interaction is responding to invitations and participating in the events. This is the default role for any user.

- **User Hosts:** App users who also create and host their own events. They will have a separate "Host Profile" in addition to their basic user profile, which will display ratings and reviews from past events they've hosted.

- **Business Hosts:** Businesses (e.g., restaurants, cafes) or Service Providers (e.g., tour guides, instructors) that use Momento to host events, promote their offerings, and gather ratings. This profile will contain business-specific information and feature ratings from past events.

Each role will have access to a different set of tools and content within the app.
