# Story 1.2: User Authentication Flow

## Status

In Progress

## Story

**As a** new user,
**I want** to sign up using SMS or email/password authentication,
**so that** I can create my account and access the Momento platform.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Sign-up screen implemented with clean, intuitive interface for both authentication options
2. SMS authentication working for US phone numbers with verification code delivery
3. Email/password authentication with proper validation and password requirements
4. Clerk integration configured with user creation and profile setup
5. Error handling and user feedback system implemented
6. Session management with secure token storage and persistence
7. Logout functionality with complete session cleanup
8. Security measures including rate limiting and audit logging

## Dev Notes

**Technology Integration:**

- Integrates with existing Clerk authentication system
- Uses Convex database for user profile storage
- Follows existing form patterns from sign-up flow
- Uses existing Convex mutation patterns for user creation

**Source Tree Integration:**

- Authentication screens in `app/(auth)/` directory
- Form components follow patterns from existing sign-up/sign-in flows
- User management mutations in `convex/user.ts`
- Session management using Expo SecureStore

**Testing Standards:**

- Test file location: `__tests__/` directories alongside auth components
- Testing framework: Jest + React Native Testing Library
- Test standards: Unit tests for all authentication flows, integration tests with Clerk API
- E2E tests for sign-up and login processes
- Security testing for authentication vulnerabilities

**Key Constraints:**

- Must work with existing Clerk integration from Story 1.1
- Must support both iOS and Android platforms
- Must maintain backward compatibility with existing authentication flow
- Must follow security best practices from `docs/development/security.md`
- Use `devLog` from `utils/devLog.ts` for authentication debugging

## Testing

**Test File Location:** `__tests__/` directories alongside auth components
**Test Standards:** Unit tests for all authentication flows, integration tests with Clerk API
**Testing Frameworks:** Jest + React Native Testing Library
**Specific Testing Requirements:**

- Unit tests for all authentication flows
- Integration tests with Clerk API
- E2E tests for sign-up and login processes
- Security testing for authentication vulnerabilities
- Cross-platform testing (iOS/Android)
