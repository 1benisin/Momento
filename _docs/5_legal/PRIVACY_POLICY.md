# Momento Privacy Policy

## Our Matching Philosophy: Powered by You

At Momento, our goal is to create magical events where you genuinely connect with others. To do this, our matching system learns from your interactions within the app. This section explains exactly what data we use and why. This information is **always** kept private and is **never** shared with other users.

### Interest Vectors

- **What it is**: A profile of your interests based on the Possibility Cards you swipe on, events you attend, and feedback you provide.
- **How we use it**: To invite you to events we think you'll love. If you love live music and hiking, we'll look for events and people who share those passions.

### Contribution Score

- **What it is**: An internal score that reflects your positive engagement with the community. It goes up when you attend events you've confirmed, and when you receive private, anonymous kudos from fellow attendees.
- **How we use it**: To reward reliable and kind community members. A higher contribution score may give you priority for high-demand events. It helps us ensure that everyone at an event is committed to being there.

### Internal Attractiveness Rating

- **What it is**: This is a private, internal metric based on anonymized interactions in the "Discover Your Type" feature. It helps us understand the types of profiles that resonate with you and that others find engaging. It is **not** a public "hotness" score.
- **How we use it**: To refine the pool of people you see and who see you, increasing the chances of mutual connection. It helps us understand connection preferences on a broad, anonymized level to improve the experience for everyone.

**Your Data, Your Control**

We are committed to building a system that is not only effective but also transparent and trustworthy. This document is a starting point for that conversation. We will expand this policy to be comprehensive and clear. You will always be able to access it from your profile settings.
