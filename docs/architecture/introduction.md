# Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for Momento, a social platform designed to foster genuine human connection through curated, real-world group events. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development, ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack, from the Convex backend to the React Native (Expo) frontend.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and frontend architecture documents. It is designed to streamline the development process for a modern fullstack application where backend and frontend concerns are deeply intertwined. The architecture is built upon an existing codebase that utilizes React Native with Expo, Expo Router for navigation, NativeWind for styling, Convex for the backend, and Clerk for authentication.
