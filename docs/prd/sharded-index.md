## Development Workflow

Each story is now a focused, manageable unit that can be implemented independently. Development agents can:

1. **Select a story** from the appropriate epic
2. **Review acceptance criteria** for clear implementation guidance
3. **Implement the story** with focused scope
4. **Mark as complete** when all acceptance criteria are met

## Story Status Tracking

Stories can be tracked with the following statuses:

- **Draft**: Story created, ready for development
- **In Progress**: Development started
- **Review**: Implementation complete, ready for QA
- **Done**: Story fully implemented and tested
